## Problem Statement:
* THEME: Retail & Logistics

* PROBLEM NAME: Conversational interface

* DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT: Customers are unable to 'look & feel' the product sitting at the comfort of their homes, so there is always an ambiguity of not knowing that their purchase was right or not. Building trust in the product or seller in an online marketplace has always been a challenge.
This is specifically true in India, where the Customer relies on its physical shopping experience, with many shopping assistants to build trust on their purchase or the seller.
Additionally, non-tech savvy users find it difficult to navigate through non-intuitive online interfaces.
The objective is to create a conversational interface that guides non-tech savvy buyers through the online shopping experience while also providing the immersive experience that provides a real world “shopping feel”. Immersive experience would be useful for fashion shopping where the buyer gets to “try out” whatever they’re trying to buy.
The conversational interface should provide interaction through natural language speech / text & similar types of intuitive interfaces.

## Solution:
* Our solution is creating an interface between Seller and Consumer where they can directly interact with each other and chat (By Text & Audio) using our website the consumers get satisfactory answers from the seller side and they get surety about the products. And from the seller's perspective the chances are increased that a person can come back to purchase the product. Let we see prototype of our website, using prototype it will be easy to understandable .

* According to the Prototype we have two different way for for conveartation between customer and saller:

> Direct Connect with Sallesman

> Using Admin connect with sallesman

### Direct Connect with Sallesman:

In a Direct Connect with Salesman we provide an interface for Saller & Consumer and Manager. Saller has a unique name when they upload their product, which can be provided in a detailed section for consumers. Using that name they can directly connect with the salesman and ask any question. In this Managers can able to ban or restrict those person who is doing spams.
