## Problem Statement:
* THEME: Retail & Logistics

* PROBLEM NAME: Conversational interface

* DESCRIPTION OF THE PROBLEM STATEMENT: Customers are unable to 'look & feel' the product sitting at the comfort of their homes, so there is always an ambiguity of not knowing that their purchase was right or not. Building trust in the product or seller in an online marketplace has always been a challenge.
This is specifically true in India, where the Customer relies on its physical shopping experience, with many shopping assistants to build trust on their purchase or the seller.
Additionally, non-tech savvy users find it difficult to navigate through non-intuitive online interfaces.
The objective is to create a conversational interface that guides non-tech savvy buyers through the online shopping experience while also providing the immersive experience that provides a real world ‚Äúshopping feel‚Äù. Immersive experience would be useful for fashion shopping where the buyer gets to ‚Äútry out‚Äù whatever they‚Äôre trying to buy.
The conversational interface should provide interaction through natural language speech / text & similar types of intuitive interfaces.

And from the seller's perspective the chances are increased that a person can come back to purchase the product.
